# Informing

<hr>

## Collecting Information 

<ul><li> The first thing both of us had to do was get into a group. After we got into a group togheter, we needed to decide what kind of project both of us want to do. We quickly got into an agreement, about wanting to do a TicTacToe game. TicTacToe is a very easy game, and since both of us had very less (or even no at all) programming experiences, it was the best thing to do.</li></ul>

## Informing if we can do this project 

<ul><li> We both had to discuss if we even had any kind of programming experiences. Leona had no experiences at all, meanwhile Fabiano already had some programming experiences. Fabiano had already started to do some programming at work, while Leona had to do the Ã¼K. We both discussed about how far we can get with our project and we decided that with a little help from some YouTube Tutorials and some online Texts we could definitely do it. </li></ul>

## Assigment Brief
We also filled out an Assigment Brief, to Inform ourselfs, what exactely we need to do.

## Tools 

#### VS Studio Code
<p> We needed to download and istall VS code, so we could start programming our game. </p>

#### GitHub
<p> We needed to open a GitHub account and had to create a repository, also we needed GitHub to write our Documentation there. </p>

#### Youtube 
<p> We watched some YT Tutorials to get a better view on how to start with our code</p>

#### Google-/drive/docs
<p> We had to use Google to do some research about our code and we had to use Google Drive/Docs because we needed to fill out some documents our Teacher gave us. </p>

#### Excel
<p> On excel we did all of our tables.</p>

#### ChatGPT
<p> We needed to use ChatGPT to design our code a little. We did do the research first, but we werent sure how to put that into our code, so we asked ChatGPT.</p>
