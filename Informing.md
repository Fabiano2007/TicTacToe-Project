# Informing

<hr>

## Collecting Information 

<ul><li> The first thing both of us had to do was get into a group. After we got into a group together, we needed to decide what kind of project both of us wanted to do. We quickly got into an agreement, about wanting to do a Tic-tac-toe game. Tic-tac-toe is a very easy game, and since both of us had very little (or even no at all) programming experience, it was the best thing to do.</li></ul>

## Informing if we can do this project 

<ul><li> We both had to discuss if we even had any kind of programming experience. Leona had no experience at all, meanwhile, Fabiano already had some programming experience. Fabiano had already started to do some programming at work, while Leona had to do the üK. We both discussed how far we could get with our project, and we decided that with a little help from some YouTube Tutorials and some online texts, we could do it. </li></ul>

## Assigment Brief
We also filled out an Assignment Brief, to inform ourselves, what exactly we needed to do.

## Tools 

#### VS Studio Code
<p> We needed to download and install VS Code, so we could start programming our game. </p>

#### GitHub
<p> GitHub is an app, where we can push and commit codes or open repositories. We need GitHub, so our Teacher can take a look at our project, and so we can save all our things.  </p>

#### Google-/drive/docs
<p> We had to use Google to do some research about our code, and we had to use Google Drive/Docs because we needed to fill out some documents our Teacher gave us. </p>

#### Excel
<p> In Excel, we did all of our tables. </p>

<hr> 

## What did we ask ChstGPT? 
<p> We asked ChatGPT very simple questions, we mostly asked him something when we couldn't figure out a problem. </p>

<ul>
<li> Where is the mistake in our code?</li>
<li> Why isn't our code working? </li>
<li> Why istn't our computer always thinking logical?</li>
</ul>
