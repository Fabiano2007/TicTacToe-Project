# Planing: 

<ul><li> Our Teacher gave us a few Dokuments to fill, so we did that first. We had to fill an Assigment Brief, where we documnet our Goals and our milestones. On Excel we did a Timetable. 
On our Timetable we noted on which days we can work on our project and how long we can work on it. Togheter we also had to do a Tasklist. We disscused long about who is going to do which Task, but in the end we came to a very fair decision. 
Fabiano would do most of the programming, while Leona does most of the Documentation. Besides these tasks, we also had to do a Table, where we needed to write down what we should do, in the worst case scenario. We also tried not to make our goals to big, becuase we didn't want to not be able to achiev it and put ourselfs in stress. </li></ul>

## How was our Plan made

<p> As soon as we decided what project we want to do, and we did the informing, we started planning. We first started to write down all the things that need to be done (Documentation, Coding, Finalizing, Accepting and all the other things.). After we got a list done with all the things we think are important, we started to arrange them into a order of "What is the most importatn" to "What is less important". In the end we showed the list to our Teacher and after he approved of it we started working.</p>

## Milestones
We have discussed and decided on a few Milesotnes. 

<ul>
  <li> Coding Complete </li>
  <p> Our Code should be done for the first time. Wihtout any finalizing or any perfectioning.</p>
  <li> Start Testing </li>
  <p> We want to start testing very soon after our Code is done, because we have many diffrent testing protocolls and we also want some of our friends/family members to test it</p>
  <li> Stop Testing </li>
  <p> After we tested we also want to be done with it, because being done with the testing means being very close to being finished with our project.</p>
  <li>Finalize the code and Docuemtation</li>
  <p> After we stopped testing it is time to finalize our code. Changing/adding some small details to our code. After we did this we can say that the Documentation is also nearly done.</p>
  <li> Accepted </li>
  <p> As soon as all the other Milestones are completed it is time that we accept the way our code and our documentation is. We need to accept the way it turned out.</p>
  
</ul>

## Managing our Time

<p> Luckily me and Fabiano did a great time table. There were some days we couldn't work as we planned but we decided to work on other days more. Also we were lucky that Fabiano new about going to Holidays soon enough, so we could include that into our time. Till now we never had any complications with our Time managing. Since we both made a Taslist in the beginning we could plan eversthing smoothly. The only mistake we made was that we didnt plan time for including our Feedback into our Project. Needing to do some diffrences to your project also takes up time, which we forgot to include. Luckily we currently have Holidays and at work we are sometimes allowed to work on our Project, so we do the updating there. </p>
