# Realising 

<hr>

## Setting up
<ul>
  <li>GitHub</li>
  <p>We had already learned how to open a Respository, since we had to do it at Work once. So Fabiano opened a Respository and invited us all.</p>
  <li>VS Code</li>
  <p>We already had the VS Code on our computer, since we had to use it at School and Work before. We didnt really do much with the VS Code but we created some new Folders to hav eeverything structured.</p>
</ul>

## Codes

<p> Here are some code examples. </p>

#### 1 
<p>This is the first part of our code. We think this could be like half of the code we are going too have in the end, but we arent sure. If you would run this code, there would be nothing,
  because we decided to part our code into two diffrent functions to make it easier for both of us.

#### 2 
<p>This is the second code we ever pushed onto Github. Here we programmed the "Game Over". If you would ever lose the game, the game over would show to let you know. 
  Even here, when you run this code nothing is going to be showing, but it is good to have it here. </p>

#### 3 

<p>This is the "last" part we had tp programm for our base to be done. There are still a few things we need to add to our game, but if you would run the game now you could already play. You would firstly get into a small instruction to the game, then you would need to press enter to start playing. Ass soon as you press enter you and someone else can play our game of TicTacToe.</p>

  ## Problems 
  
  #### 1. 
  <p>In The first code example we did run into some problems. When we started writing the code we did it all in the main. When we did it in the main we ran into many diffrent mistakes and we couldn't really figure them all our because it didnt always make much sense. We had already run into this kind of problem before at work, and there they told us we are making it to complicated with doing everything in the main so we split it up. When we split it up we didnt have any problems anymore.</p>  
  
  #### 3. 

  <p> While we werde doing th last we did have some small problems like forgetting a semicolon, not closing a tag and other small problems. Luckily we never ran into big problems, where we couldn't solve them.</p>

## Backing up our Work

#### Sending me the code 
<p>Everytime Fabiano would finish the code he would send the code to me so i could also have a look. Also i would always save the code into a Folder. </p>

#### Push and Commit on GitHub
<p>Fabiano would always Push and Commit the code onto GitHub so not only we and our Teacher can have a look at it but so it would be somewhere safe.</p>
