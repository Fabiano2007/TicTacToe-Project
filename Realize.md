## Codes

<p> Here are some code examples. </p>

<p>This is the first part of our code. We think this could be like half of the code we are going too have in the end, but we arent sure. If you would run this code, there would be nothing,
  because we decided to part our code into two diffrent functions to make it easier for both of us. In the beggining we did have some problems, because we werent 100% sure if we wanted to do it all in the main or do it in two diffrent functions.
  That was the only problem we had so far.</p>

<p>This is the second code we ever pushed onto Github. Here we programmed the "Game Over". If you would ever lose the game, the game over would show to let you know. 
  Even here, when you run this code nothing is going to be showing, but it is goos to have it here. </p>
