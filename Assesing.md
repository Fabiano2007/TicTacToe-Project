## Reflectio 

#### What did we like about our processs and why? 

<ul> 
<li> We are glad that we got to finish our project on time and that we did not run into any stress. I think if that would've happened we would have lost focus and our project would not be as good as now. </li>
<li> We are both happy that we could both improve our skills, since we definitelly will be needing them again. </li>
<li> The Teacher and our friends were helpfull when we had any quesetions about the projects.  </li>
<li> Eventhoug we did run into some probekms, we are happy they weren't as big. big problems take up a lot of time and they can get you very frustrated.</li>
<li> Also we are very happpy that our game works withouht any major problems </li>
</ul>

#### What can we improve for the next project? 
<ul>
<li> We could definetelly take up more time to test our project. It would be more helpful. </li>
<li> Maybe for the next time our milestones could be more challenging than this time.</li>
</ul>

#### What difficulties/problems have been faced? 
<ul>
<li> In the beginning we had a lot of difficulities with Github. We didnt know how to write a proper documentation, how to psuh our code and how to use it overall. Over the time we learned everything we need to know and we are it didnt affect our problem to much. </li>

<li> We also didnt plan to much time for out testing, which now leads to us not being able to fix all of our issues. Those issues dont affect our game in a bad way, but it still would have been nice to have those fixed. </li>
</ul>
