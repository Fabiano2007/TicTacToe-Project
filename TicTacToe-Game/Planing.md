# Planing: 

<ul><li> Our Teacher gave us a few Dokuments to fill, so we did that first. We had to fill an Assigment Brief, where we documnet our Goals and our milestones. On Excel we did a Timetable. 
On our Timetable we noted on which days we can work on our project and how long we can work on it.  </li></ul>
