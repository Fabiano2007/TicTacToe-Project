## Decison Matrix 

Before we agreed on making a TicTacToe game, we both wanted to do a Rock Paper Scissors game. In the end we decided againt it, because we thought Rock Paper Scissors would be to easy and we wanted to set us a challenge. 
We both wanted our first project to be a slight challenge and not to easy. With the help of some research on how easy each project would be and our on skills, we changed it.

<ul>
<li>Type of Game </li>
<p> Type of game was an important Matrix Criteria for us, since we were thinking between doing it on C or Java Script. For Java Script you also need to know about HTML and CSS. Me and Fabiano both had no experiences with Jav and little with C. </p>
<li>Programming Language</li>
<p>It was important that we knew at least a little bit of one of the languages, so we wouldn't habe that many problems.</p>
<li>Easy to Develop</li>
<p> We wanted The programming language to be easy to develop a game. After we did some research we decided c would be easier.</p>
<li>Community</li>
<p>We needed to learn more about the language communities. We figured out that C is very good for programming games and that it wouldn't be too hard. Java Script is more of the Webbdesign langauage, which we didnt need.</p></p>
<li>Prior Experiences</li>
<p>It was very important to us that we choose a langauge where we would already have some experiences. It is much easier to programm something in this way.</p>
</ul>
