## Decison Matrix 

<ul><li> Before we agreed on making a TicTacToe game, we both wanted to do a Rock Paper Scissors game. In the end we decided againt it, because we thought Rock Paper Scissors would be to easy and we wanted to set us a challenge. 
We both wanted our first project to be a slight challenge and not to easy. With the help of some research on how easy each project would be and our on skills, we changed it. </li>

## Criterias 

<ul>
<li> Time </li>
<p> We both definitely wanted to have everything done in time </p>
<li> Skills </li>
<p> It was importend to us that we can use our skills and also expand them. We also did not want to overestimate our skills.</p>
<li> Compare </li>
<p> We had to compare the two projects togheter, so we could see which once had a bigger impact on us. </p>
<li> Impact </li>
<p> We needed to see which Project would give us a better grade and whihc one could be a challenge to us so we can improve our skills. </p>
</ul>
