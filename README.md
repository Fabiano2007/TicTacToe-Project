## Introduction to our Game 
Hello and Welcome to the introduction of our Game TicTacToe. 
I think that TicTacToe is a very simple game, everyone knows. You are either X or O and need to put your letter into a Field. 
The first Person who's letters are in 1 row won. 

Our Game is a little bit diffrent. 

We decided that we will use L and F instead of X and O, because we wanted it to be a little more personal.
Also to put the symbol into a field you need to add numbers. 
Here is an picture to help you understand better:

Each Field has a number, if you want the symbol F to be in the middle you need to enter number 5.     
This was the easiest way for us to do our game.
